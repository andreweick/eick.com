Dear Aunt Annie --

"Somewhat suprirsed" to receive your letter the other day -- but that wasn't
anything to how glad I was to get it!

Things are pretty busy around here these days -- you know we are coming home!  
Glory of glories!  Home -- believe me, to a kid who had practically never even
reached the end of his Mother's apron strings, only to be thrown so absolutely
on his "own" for a year -- a good part of the time with no mail -- in a strange
country, that word has a magic that attracts every bit of him, and nearly
leaves him speechless from emotion at the very thought of going back!  But such
is the case; they formed us into casual companies today, we probably will make
the trip to the coast about the tenth and sail about the twentieth.  That means
"Home and Mother" in July!

Well, I'll stop my raving now but you can see that you can expect very little
of me, I'm too wrought up to even talk rational.

Do you really mean to say that George is good about writing? He surely must have
a motive of some kind -- maybe he's in love with you! (At that I wouldn't blame
him -- for I remember a might pretty little Southern girl as my 'Aunt Annie'.)

You will have to overlook the paper, the blots, and the bum writing! The first
two are result of conditions which I make no excuse for (I'm sitting on my
bunk writing with a mirror to lay the paper on) but I'm heartily ashamed of the
latter!

I'm afraid that I'll have to disagree with you about those cousins of mine
growing up! If they are like me I don't think they'll ever grow up -- I don't
believe I ever will inside! But if ever I can, you can bet I'm going to "try
you and see" -- for I want to see all of you in the worst kind of way! And if
I ever do I'm going to bring Mother with me, for we are 'Pals' to, and mighty
good ones at that!

And now you had to go and spoil that perfectly good effect I got off a little
while ago by that 'awful' description of me as a baby three years old! I think
that is really mean -- and I'm mortified nearly to death!

And now for what you left "unsaid" (Uncle Howard's part)!  I don't think that
it was fair for him to make fun of you, do you Aunt Annie?  I've seen Mother
leave things unsaid -- she'd either run out of time or her audeience would
disappear! I'm sorry that I didn't get that other letter of yours, Uncle Howard,
but than as long as I know you wrote I'm pleased for I know that a busy man has
little time to write to a faraway nephew even if he does think of him at times!

Well, folks, I'm almost out of things to say -- I knew I couldn't be orginial
enough to write a good letter! So it will have to be just good by and good luck
and lots of love to all. And those cousins of mine had better not forget their
"corn fed" Iowa relations -- or we'll be down by first aeroplane and "clean up"!

Yours,

Wilber Sackett
