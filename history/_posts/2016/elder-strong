Elder John Strong     b. circa 1605, d. 14 April 1699

It is thought that John was born circa 1605 at Tauton, Somerset, England.

Also, information indicates that John was born circa 1610 at Chard,Somerset, Canterbury, England.

Marriage
5 December 1629 Elder John Strong married Margery Deane 5 December 1629 or 1630 in England. She died crossing the Atlantic to the colonies in about 1630. It is believed that she had at least one child in England, John Jr. who is said to have been born in 1626. Therefore we are assuming that she was at least 18 when he was born and therefore born on or about 1608. He then married Abigail Ford who was about 16 at the time in 1635.


Immigration
20 May 1630 Elder John Strong and Margery Deane immigrated on 20 May 1630 from Plymouth, England. Having strong Puritan sympathies he sailed from Plymouth for the new world, March 20, 1630, in company with 140 persons, in the ship Mary and John (Capt. Squeb) and arrived at Nantasket, Massachusetts, about twelve miles southeast from Boston, after a passage of more than seventy days in length, on Sunday, May 30, 1630. His wife, Margery, young son John Jr. were on this trip also. A baby was born and died at sea as did Margery.

The original destination of the vessel was Charles river; but an unfortunate misunderstanding which arose between the captain and the passengers, resulted in their being put summarily ashore by him at Nantasket. After searching for a few days, for a good place in which to settle and make homes for themselves, they decided upon the spot, which they called Dorchester, in memory of the endeared home in England which many of them had left.

 1635
 In 1635, after having assisted in founding and developing the town of Dorchester, John Strong removed to Hingham, Massachusetts., and on March 9, 1636, took the freeman's oath at Boston. His stay at Hingham was short, as on Dec 4, 1638, he is found to have been an inhabitant and proprietor of  Taunton, Mass., and to have been made in that year a freeman of Plymouth Colony. He remained at Taunton, as late at any rate as 1645, as he was a deputy thence to the General court in Plymouth, in 1641, 1643, and 1644. From Taunton he removed to Windsor, CT, where he was appointed with four others, Capt. John Mason, Roger Ludlow, Israel Stoughton, and Henry Wolcott, all very leading men in the infant colony, "to superintend and bring forward the settlement of that place," which had been settled a few years before (1636) by a portion of the same colony that with him had founded Dorchester. Windsor was in fact called at first, and for several years (1636-1650), Dorchester.

 During John Strong's 40 years in Northampton, he was honored and trusted above most men in secular and religious matters.  He was deeply religious.  So great was the confidence in his honesty and integrity the town voted that all hides should be taken to him to be tanned, at his own price.  He was a tanner by trade, and he built the first tannery there.He was also a husbandman (farmer), and he owned 200 acres around Northampton.  In 1663 he was elected ruling elder and was ordained.

The purity of his private life, the consistency of his Christian character, his experience in worldly affairs, and his general intelligence, pointed to him as a proper person to fill the position of ruling elder, which position was second only to that of pastor.  He was one of the 6 Dorchester men who were heartily welcomed to Northampton for their character and skills.  He was one of the seven pinllars of the church there.   By his second wife John had 15 children and when he died at the age of 94.
