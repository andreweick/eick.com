Today's world is moving so fast that it isn't until later in life that a man has
the time to reflect on what his country has done for him and what he can do to 
keep alive the feelings of patriotism and love of country.

It's a cycle really, the young man out of the service after
giving two or more years of his life to help in the contiunally 
important job of defending the country, coming home with a
feeling of pride and relief that he was able to return to his
family alive.

However, that young man may not see the improtrance of
active participation in the vetran's organizations. Perhaps
he is somewhat bitter about his experiences, as in the case
with many Viet Nam era soldiers.

However, for many it is merely a matter of time. There is 
also that generation gap. It is a fact that the majority of 
members of organizations such as the American Legion are
older, men who have joined this group later in life, or many of
whom have always been contributing members but not active
in the day to day affairs.

Wilber Sackett of Spencer is serving his second year as
commander of the Glen Pedersen Post Number one of the American Legion. 
These past years have been devoted to getting new members,
including the younger man and woman.

Sackett is not pessimistic about the future of the Legion
and the hesitation of the younger service people to join. He
likens it much to his own experiences when he returned home
following his years of action during World War I.

"I felt out of place," he said. He added that the young man 
today has these same feelings when he attends a meetingfind the majority of
members are much older. He said it is a generation gap and nothing more.

## Returned from war in 1918
Sackett returned from his duties in Europe in 1918. About his joing of the Legion
he says" I read in the Des Moines paper that a chapter was being formed. I went
to the meetings at the coliseum. Everyone who I talked to and everyone there
seemed to be old enough to be my father. I felt out of place. 
But that was the way it was during the war also.

Sackett didn't joing the Legion until 1923 while in Red Oak,
after he finished his education. When he moved to
Spencer in 1929 to join the John W. Cory law firm, he transferred
his membership and has since been a member.
However, it wasn't until recently, upon retirement, that he was able
to become an active member. Now the Legion and
its activities are very important parts of his and his wife,
Edith's, lives.

## Inborn patriotism
In most people there is an inborn patriotism to one's 
country. This patriotism has been questioned lately, but
Sackett feels it is there and the citizens will rally to the
support of the country when her safety or democracy is 
threatened.
