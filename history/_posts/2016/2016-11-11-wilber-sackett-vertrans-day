Today's world is moving so fast that it isn't until later in life that a man has
the time to reflect on what his country has done for him and what he can do to 
keep alive the feelings of patriotism and love of country.

It's a cycle really, the young man out of the service after
giving two or more years of his life to help in the contiunally 
important job of defending the country, coming home with a
feeling of pride and relief that he was able to return to his
family alive.

However, that young man may not see the improtrance of
active participation in the vetran's organizations. Perhaps
he is somewhat bitter about his experiences, as in the case
with many Viet Nam era soldiers.

However, for many it is merely a matter of time. There is 
also that generation gap. It is a fact that the majority of 
members of organizations such as the American Legion are
older, men who have joined this group later in life, or many of
whom have always been contributing members but not active
in the day to day affairs.

Wilber Sackett of Spencer is serving his second year as
commander of the Glen Pedersen Post Number one of the American Legion. 
These past years have been devoted to getting new members,
including the younger man and woman.

Sackett is not pessimistic about the future of the Legion
and the hesitation of the younger service people to join. He
likens it much to his own experiences when he returned home
following his years of action during World War I.

"I felt out of place," he said. He added that the young man 
today has these same feelings when he attends a meetingfind the majority of
members are much older. He said it is a generation gap and nothing more.

## Returned from war in 1918
Sackett returned from his duties in Europe in 1918. About his joing of the Legion
he says" I read in the Des Moines paper that a chapter was being formed. I went
to the meetings at the coliseum. Everyone who I talked to and everyone there
seemed to be old enough to be my father. I felt out of place. 
But that was the way it was during the war also.

Sackett didn't joing the Legion until 1923 while in Red Oak,
after he finished his education. When he moved to
Spencer in 1929 to join the John W. Cory law firm, he transferred
his membership and has since been a member.
However, it wasn't until recently, upon retirement, that he was able
to become an active member. Now the Legion and
its activities are very important parts of his and his wife,
Edith's, lives.

## Inborn patriotism
In most people there is an inborn patriotism to one's 
country. This patriotism has been questioned lately, but
Sackett feels it is there and the citizens will rally to the
support of the country when her safety or democracy is 
threatened.

This special sense of pride has been handed down in the Sackett
family, as it has in many. Wilber has today a rememberence 
of his grandfather's patriotism and love of country.

Grandfather George C. Sackett was a soldier in the Civil War. He 
was a member of the Company C First Iowa Calvary.

Upon Wilber's entry into the U.S. Army in 1918, grandfather George
inscribed his small pocket bible for Wilber to carry with him.
He also gave him a small U.S. flat, to be inserted in the
bible and carried during the time of his combat duty.

Wilber still has these articles, even though the flagis worn thin
and shredded with age. They are indeed special,
something that constantly reminds him of his service to his
country and his gradfather's before him.

Sackett's grandmother, Emma French Sackett, was also
very active during the civil war. She was a civil war nurse
and is featured in the Civil War Nursing Book. Sackett is proud
of her achievements. During the spring convention in about 1920
of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) in Des Moines, his grandmother 
was one of only seven survivors of the Civil War Nurses to be honored.

## Enlisted when 19

Upon graduation from West High School in Des Moines,
Sackett tried to enlist in the Army. However, he says he was 
rejected because he had flat feet and bad teeth. He worked
for some time as a construction laborer but never gave up the
idea of enlisting. He said he got his feet and teeth taken care
of and finally was accepted into the Army.

He took his training in Virginia and was assigned to a
combat engineers corps. He traveled to the war overseas with 
a convoy of seven ships and several sub chasers. He was
transported on the German ship Vaterland, the largest
convoy ship in the day. It was renamed the Leviathon, a name
which is well remembered by that generation of people
who knew the names of the ships and battlegrounds because it was
such an important part of their lives. The German ship was in
American Harbors when the war broke out in 1917, and therefore 
made its return trip to its homeland filled with American soldiers.

Sackett looks back now and laughts at the trip across the
Atlantic. "We zig-zagged all the way across," he says. "We
had three submarine scares but none of the ships were ever
lost. It took 12 days to get over there."

Sackett's company landed at Brest, France, in the northwest corner.
The engineering company was in charge of reopening roads which had been
damaged from explosives and fire. "We were far enough back from the 
front lines that when the armistice went into effect we found out about
it a day later," Sackett recalls.

Following the signing of the armistice, Sacket was transfered to the west 
coast of France where he worked on the French roads while
he waited for transportation back home. At the time, he remembers, all
troops were returned by ship rather than airplane. It took several
months to transport all the troops and those who saw direct combat
were returned home first. The rebuilding of the roads had a duo purpose:
to return the country to pre-war condition and to
provide jobs for the American soldiers remaing in Europe.

While in France, Sackett met up with Louis Geiermann of Dearborn, Michigan.
There were the youngest soldiers in their company
and became very good friends. Geiermann provides many memories
of the war and today the two men get together often and Geiermann has 
been to Spencer several times. The two asked to be allowed to attend 
the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) University in Beaume, France.
There they put in their time until sailing from Marseilles, France
(Southern France), through the Strait of Gibraltar and home. Those
six months at the university provided man memorable times.

"The thing I remember most," Sackett said, "is that
Geiermann liked to fly. We begged rides whenever we could.
One time we strapped into an open cockpit, the pilot
went upside down and we never begged again."

Another amusing story from Sackett's service days, is the story of how
he lost his hair. At one time he tossed his helmet in 
the ditch. The mustard gas fumes tend to go to a low place
and it settled in his helmet.  Sackett said his scapl itched
severely and by the third day he went to see the doctor about
it. The doctor had to shave Sackett's head to tread the blisters. 
Consequently, he hasn't had hair since.

## Legion started in France

Now Sackett remembers all this, and more. He recalls 
what patriotism means and he and his family are living it daily.

He looks back to the Legion when he
thinks of the veterans. The Legion was first
started in France. COL. Haywood McNider of Mason City, of the Iowa 
National Guard Rainbow Division, was instrumental in it's formation.

Sackett first read of the Legion in the "Stars and Stripes." The Iowa 
National Guardsmen saw a lot of service during the war because
the men were combat trained and ready to go right alongside the 
regular Army division. Many Iowa men were lost in that war because 
of the Iowa National Guard's participation, because the men 
fought as a unit. Especially hard hit were the communities
of Ottumwa and Red oak. Both lost a great number of
men, according to Sackett, because the men were on the front line. McNider was 
one of the principal orgranizers of the Legion, possibily
because he has so many men on the line and the Legion
was organized to help the veterans.

## The Legion has helped

The local and national American 
Legion organizations are devoted to helping the vetrans
of all wars. It took over responsibilies of the GAR and the Spainish American 
War Vetrans. There was a demise of these groups
and the revolutionary war veteran's groups.

The primary purpose of the Legion is to look
after and protect the veteran's interests. The Legion represents
them before the congress as a lobby group for
the disabled, wounded vetrans and their dependents and widows.

The American Legion also supports the veterans hospitals throughout
the country. Local veterans have attended the hospitals in Sioux 
Falls, Sioux City, Iowa City, Des Moines and Knoxville. The 
hospitalization and care is very inexpensive, according to Sackett, 
because of the Legion support.

The Legion has also been instrumental in the education of the 
children of veterans and has acted as their liason.
One of the biggest projects of the Legion each year is the Boys
State program, where youth are given a first hand experience
at understanding governmental procedures.

Locally, the Legion sponsors things for youth which
will help to build their character. The post sponsors a Boy Scout
troop and the American Legion Basketball team. In addition they work
with the Vetrans of Foreign Wars to provide a Memorial Day program and
the Avenue of Flags, both to show respect for deceased vetrans
and to promote a living patriotism. The Legion building is also
available to organiations needing a large place for
wholesome activities.

Another of the visible signs of the Legion is the military 
funeral. Last year the post held 33 for the deceased vetrans.
"This is a sign that patriotism is not dead," Sackett said.

Meanwhile, he keeps promoting Legion and Legion activites. He knows 
there will come a time when the young service men of today will have
the time to carry on the work of the Legion. "It could become a very
vital part of the community," he said.
