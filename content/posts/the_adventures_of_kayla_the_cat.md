The Adventures of Kayla the Cat

For Kayla. Keep dreaming big!

Kayla the Cat owned a zoo called Kayla the Cat’s zoo. It was home to all sorts of animals, like lions and cheetahs and crocodiles. It even had a unicorn named Una! Kayla the Cat was the zookeeper for her zoo, and made sure that all the animals in her zoo were comfortable and happy.

One day, Kayla woke up and realized that some of the animals were missing. Oh no! Kayla was sad that some of the animals had left. They were all her friends, and she wondered why they had left. She also wondered where they had gone. Even though it was a big city, Kayla knew that they couldn’t be far from the zoo. Determined, she set off to find her friends and bring them home.

The first animal she found was Una the Unicorn. Una the Unicorn was a white unicorn, with a rainbow main and a golden horn. She was patiently standing in line at a bakery behind some very surprised people. Kayla walked up behind her, and tapped her on the hoof. Una looked down. “Kayla,” she whinnied, “hop up.”
Kayla hopped up onto Una’s back. “What are you doing here, Una?” Kayla asked. “Why did you leave the zoo?”
“Well, I was sitting in my stable when suddenly I heard a big crash. I looked up, and saw Timmy the Tiger break out of his cage. He growled loudly, which scared the horn right off my head! I got so scared that I broke out of my stable, and didn’t stop running until I saw a butterfly. I followed it down the street, and then I stopped when I saw these yummy cakes in the window. They looked so yummy that I decided to come in and buy some!”

“Do you know why Timmy was running away, Una?” asked Kayla.
“No, but he looked really mad and scared.”
“Well, we can ask him when we find him. Why don’t you come with me, Una? We can find the rest of the animals together.”
“Can I get my cake first, please?” asked Una.
“When we get home, Una, you can have all of the cakes you want!”
Una the Unicorn smiled, and walked out of the bakery. Kayla was still riding on her back.

The next animal that they found was Ollie the Ostrich. Una and Kayla found Ollie running around a track. He was going around really fast! Kayla mewed loudly, and Ollie came to a stop right in front of her and Una. He took out a monocle, and placed it over one of his eyes. “Hello, Ollie.” Kayla and Una said.
“How can I help you, Kayla and Una?” Ollie asked.
“What are you doing here, Ollie?” Kayla asked. “I’m running laps, of course.” Ollie replied.
“But why did you leave the zoo?” Kayla asked. “Because Timmy the Tiger scared me when he
escaped.” replied Ollie. “My fast legs started running, and before I knew it I was here, on the track. I’ve been running laps ever since.”

“Timmy scared me too!” Una said.
“How curious.” Ollie replied.
“Huh?” both Kayla and Una said, tilting their
heads to one side.
“Never mind.” Ollie said.
“Come with us, Ollie.” Kayla said, “you can
help us find the other animals that have escaped.” “Very well.” said Ollie, and followed Una and
Kayla as they walked away from the track and towards the road.

The next animal they found was Cleo the Cheetah and her cubs. They were in a park. Cleo’s cubs were playing with each other in the grass while Cleo sat off to the side, silently watching them. “Hello, Cleo.” Kayla said, still on Una’s back.
Cleo looked up at Kayla. “Hello Kayla the Cat. Hello Una the Unicorn. Hello Ollie the Ostrich.”
“Hello.” they all said back.
“What are you doing here?” Ollie asked, staring at her through his monocle.
“I’m watching my cubs play.” replied Cleo. “They can be very rough sometimes, you know.”
“Oh, I bet.” Una said.

“What are you doing in the park, Cleo?” Kayla said.
“Well, I was getting the cubs ready for bedtime when I heard a growl. I looked out to see Timmy the Tiger running through the zoo. I got very scared, so I took all of the cubs and escaped through the hole in the fence that Timmy had left. I kept walking until I found this park. I’m very happy to see all of you.”
Cleo stood up. Her cubs came over, and stood next to her. “Kayla,” she said, “is it safe to go home?”
“We’re very far away,” replied Kayla. “I think it would be better if you and your cubs came with us instead to find the other animals.”
“Okay.” Cleo said. She walked next to Una as the four animals left the park.

The next animal the group found was Henry the Hippo. He was sitting in a big fountain. “Hello Henry!” Kayla said.
“Hello Kayla.” Henry said. He noticed the animals behind Kayla. “Hello everybody. What are you doing here?”
“We’re looking for you, Henry.”
“Why are you looking for me? I’ve been in my lake all day.”
“Actually, you’re in a fountain.” said Ollie.
Henry looked around, and realized that he was in a fountain. “Huh.” he said, and then smiled, showing his big teeth. “That’s funny.”

“Why are you in a fountain, Henry?” asked Kayla.
“I think I got scared by Timmy the Tiger.” replied Henry.
“Timmy the Tiger, always Timmy the Tiger.” Ollie said. “That mean Tiger. Why did he have to scare all of us?”
“Ollie, don’t be mean!” Una said. “There’s a reason why Timmy escaped, and when we find him, we’ll ask him.”
“Henry,” Kayla said, “how about you come with us. Can you get out of the fountain?”
“Yeah, I can.” replied Henry.
Henry hopped out of the fountain and onto the ground. His short little legs started moving, and soon he was walking in line with the group of animals.

Finally, they found Timmy the Tiger. He was sitting in the back of a library, reading a book with reading glasses. He looked up at the group of animals, and closed his book. “So, you found me.” he said.
“Why did you leave, Timmy?” all of the animals asked him.
Timmy looked sad. “Because I was lonely.” he said.
“Aw.” Una said. “Timmy, why are you lonely?” “Because I don’t have any friends.” Timmy said.

“Timmy, we’re all your friends.” Kayla said. “No you’re not.” he said. “You think I’m scary.” “You are.” said Ollie.
“That’s not true.” Kayla said.
Kayla tapped Una lightly with a paw. “Una, are you friends with Timmy?”
“Of course I’m friends with Timmy!” Una said. “He helps me polish my horn. It’s very hard for me to polish it by myself, you know.”
“Of course.” said Kayla. She turned to Ollie. “Is Timmy your friend?”
Ollie seemed to think about it for a minute, and then nodded. “Yes, even though he’s very scary. He times me when I run around the track, and helps me get faster.”

Kayla nodded, and then turned to Cleo. “Cleo, is Timmy your friend?”
“Of course!” replied Cleo. “He helps me watch my cubs!”
“And Henry,” Kayla said, “is Timmy your friend?”
“Oh, yeah, of course.” Henry said, and then stuck out his teeth. “He helps me brush my teeth. They’re hard to reach them with my short legs.”
Kayla looked at Timmy. Timmy the Tiger looked at all of his friends. “What do you know.” he said. “I do have friends.”
“Come on, Timmy.” Kayla said, and put her paw on his shoulder. “Let’s go home.”

That night, all the animals slept with Timmy in his bed. Timmy didn’t feel lonely anymore. He felt happy.

The End
