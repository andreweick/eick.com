[Carol's][1] birthday would have been today, I think she would have been 58?  It's a different world without her for sure.

I was looking for pictures of her I hadn't [posted before][2] and couldn't find any.  I have her Disneyland ID here on my desk, so I'll use that -- fitting in that we just got back from Disney World ourselves.
