Libby (and Jasmine) got a hoop skirt when we went up to Gettysburg.  Libby (of course) had to model it, Jasmine only wore it once.  I think Libby is going to go as "civil war girl" for Halloween.  We went up to Gettysburg (with Agony) and it was *so hot* -- just unbearable!  We picked a really good weekend to go up, though, because the re-enactors were out so we were able to see a special show.  (Camps, etc).
