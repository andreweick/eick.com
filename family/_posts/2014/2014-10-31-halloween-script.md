Libby wrote me a script for when Trick or Treaters come by, just in case I forget what to say.

***

***Halloween Script***

So, this is what you say to the trick-or-treaters(the () means don't say or something that you say depending on the thing):

"Hi! What are you suppose to be? (comment on costumes.) Here you go!  Take 4 or less. Bye!"[^1]

[^1]: Remember, this is just an outline. You may take away or add things.
