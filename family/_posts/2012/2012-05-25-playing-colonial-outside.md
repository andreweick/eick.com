After school Libby wanted to play Colonial in her new dress (I really like periwinkle, Daddy), and she somehow talked Jasmine into it.  Libby tried to look glum for the picture because "Back in the olden days they didn't smile for iPhone pictures because life was hard back then and they didn't have anything to smile about."
