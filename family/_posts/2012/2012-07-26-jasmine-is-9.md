Jasmine is nine years old today.  This is the first picture I ever took of Jasmine.  I got to the hotel, and they showed up about 2 minutes after.  I hadn't even taken off my backpack when they came in.  A disheveled Chinese man, an older child (maybe 3 or 4) and Jasmine (or An Jian as they called her).  Her clothes were dirty and she had a towel that she used as blanket.  I put the bib on her because she was drooling like crazy.  Everyone left about 5 minutes later and Jasmine cried and cried and cried.  She finally fell asleep from exhaustion and I took this picture.

The next morning I cleaned her up and we had to go to the government building for her adoption
