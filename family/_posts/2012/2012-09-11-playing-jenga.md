[Agony](/blog/2012/08/28/agony-in-virginia/) came to the correct coast for meetings in DC.  He is only here for a day and a half but was able to stop by and see the girls.

Jasmine wanted to play Jenga, so Chris built a pretty precarious tower that Jasmine was trying not to toplle.  The last three pictures are before, during, and after the final move (where everything fell down).

(only iPhone pictures, so not very clear!)
