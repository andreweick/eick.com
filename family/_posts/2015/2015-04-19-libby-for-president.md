Libby's campaign speech she made.


My President Speech By: Libby Eick, 5th grade 

“Hi, my name is Libby Eick, and I want to be your SCA president(long pause). 
	
I’m active at Franklin Sherman. You may find me shelving books at the library during my recess time, or before school starts. I’m well known among the Franklin Sherman staff, and I was a SCA representative for my class in third grade(short pause). Having been at Franklin Sherman for five years, I know everything about it, and really like it! I also like performing. I performed piano at an end-of-the-year assembly, and a duet with my sister, too. I also perform in the Washington Children’s Chorus, and too many piano recitals to count. These performances have given me leadership qualities that I will bring to the SCA Council(long pause).

If you ask any of my teachers, they’ll tell you that I turn all my work in on time, and that I’m a very fast typer on the computer. I may even be the fastest typer in my class! These administrative attributes will help me be a better SCA president(long pause)! 
	
As your president, I’ll work hard to listen to all your ideas about spirit days and any other school events, and make sure to fight for them in SCA meetings. As you all know, we’ve had the same spirit days for a long time. I like the traditional spirit days as much as anybody else, but maybe it’s time for some new spirit day traditions(long pause).
	
Vote for Libby(short pause), because you’ll like Eick!” ;-)
