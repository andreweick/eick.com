Libby and Jasmine showing Kumon medals. Kumon is extra math and reading problems that they do for extra drill of school work.  I don't remember the specifics of why Libby won a trophy and Jasmine medals, but it had to do with Libby being at a higher level (relative to her grade level than Jasmine). Libby can do well in school, but it's hard to keep her motivated to work (probably like Agony when he was in grade school?)
