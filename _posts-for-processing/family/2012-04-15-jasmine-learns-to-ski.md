Jasmine's first time on skis from 2008.  Now that the weather is finally turning warm, the girls are getting pretty tired of ice skating and want to move to new activities.  These pictures we took in Michigan in 2008 when they learned to ski for the first time.  Jasmine does not look happy.  I asked her about it yesterday and she said she remembers and that it really wasn't as bad as it looked.  Libby went down once or twice, then decided to go in and sit in the lodge.  Even back then she wasn't very athletic.
