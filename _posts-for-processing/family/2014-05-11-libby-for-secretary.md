#### Libby running for Secretary in Elemantary school for 5th grade, May 11, 2014.

Hi. My name is Libby Eick, and I'm running for secretary.

I like music. You may remember me from when I played a piano solo and a piano duet with my sister Jasmine at a school assembly.

I also help in the library every day, and I enjoy writing and reading books to first graders. When I was in third grade, I represented my class as an SEA representative.

As you can see, I'm active in Franklin Sherman.

As secretary, I will make sure the spirit day ideas are new and fresh. I will also take detailed notes about each and everyone of the spirit days so that we will never forget them.

When you vote, remember me, Libby Eick, for secretary.
