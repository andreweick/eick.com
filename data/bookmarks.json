{"href":"http:\/\/www.archives.gov\/exhibits\/charters\/constitution_founding_fathers_massachusetts.html","description":"Caleb Strong America's Founding Fathers - Delegates to the Constitutional Convention","extended":"Strong was born to Caleb and Phebe Strong on January 9, 1745 in Northampton, MA. He received his college education at Harvard, from which he graduated with highest honors in 1764. Like so many of the delegates to the Constitutional Convention, Strong chose to study law and was admitted to the bar in 1772. He enjoyed a prosperous country practice.\n\nFrom 1774 through the duration of the Revolution, Strong was a member of Northampton's committee of safety. In 1776 he was elected to the Massachusetts General Court and also held the post of county attorney for Hampshire County for 24 years. He was offered a position on the state supreme court in 1783 but declined it.\n\nAt the Constitutional Convention, Strong counted himself among the delegates who favored a strong central government. He successfully moved that the House of Representatives should originate all money bills and sat on the drafting committee. Though he preferred a system that accorded the same rank and mode of election to both houses of Congress, he voted in favor of equal representation in the Senate and proportional in the House. Strong was called home on account of illness in his family and so missed the opportunity to sign the Constitution. However, during the Massachusetts ratifying convention, he took a leading role among the Federalists and campaigned strongly for ratification.\n\nMassachusetts chose Strong as one of its first U.S. senators in 1789. During the 4 years he served in that house, he sat on numerous committees and participated in framing the Judiciary Act. Caleb Strong wholeheartedly supported the Washington administration. In 1793 he urged the government to send a mission to England and backed the resulting Jay's Treaty when it met heated opposition.\n\nCaleb Strong, the Federalist candidate, defeated Elbridge Gerry to become Governor of Massachusetts in 1800. Despite the growing strength of the Democratic party in the state, Strong won reelection annually until 1807. In 1812 he regained the governorship, once again over Gerry, and retained his post until he retired in 1816. During the War of 1812 Strong withstood pressure from the Secretary of War to order part of the Massachusetts militia into federal service. Strong opposed the war and approved the report of the Hartford Convention, a gathering of New England Federalists resentful of Jeffersonian policies.\n\nStrong died on November 7, 1819, 2 years after the death of his wife, Sarah. He was buried in the Bridge Street Cemetery in Northampton. Four of his nine children survived him.","meta":"db583cba66ed63576440e5f67b0e2a8f","hash":"012680c0d6a31996af786ccafda0b77e","time":"2016-08-13T23:07:57Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"family-tree"},

OS \r\nX Yosemite is a big leap forward for OS X\u2019s user interface and the way it \r\ninteracts with iOS.\r\n\r\nLike Mavericks before it, OS X Yosemite is available for free on the Mac \r\nApp Store. The annual verbiage about checking on system requirements, \r\nhaving a good backup and making sure your third-party apps work on the new \r\noperating system all apply this year.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Yosemite\r\n\r\nInstead of a wide-ranging review, life (READ: starting Relay FM, having a \r\nbaby, etc.) dictated I spend time on just the revamped UI.
